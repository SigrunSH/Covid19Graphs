# Covid19Graphs
Graphs made to illustrate covid19 pandemic

The covid19 data is from here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv

The population data estimated value fetched here: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/

I chose the population estimated for 2019 since we are quite early in 2020.
